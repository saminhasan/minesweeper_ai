# Minesweeper Solver: Initial Implementation

This repository is my first attempt at working with Minesweeper solvers. It is based on [MrGris's](https://mrgris.com/projects/minesweepr/) Bayesian solver, which calculates cell probabilities with perfect logic. 
I used [his Python repo](https://github.com/mrgriscom/minesweepr/) as the base and modified it slightly to work with Python 3. 

The project includes a basic Minesweeper UI to test how to use MrGris's solver could be used. This was a starting point to understand the solver's logic and pygame UI test.
